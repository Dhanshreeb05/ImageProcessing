# Support for using the program graphical user interface.

1.  The program will start with just a LOAD button. Clicking on it will prompt you to select an
    image from the system of the formats jpg, png or ppm.

2.  The image will be displayed on the left side of the window and the histogram will be
    displayed on the right side of the window. The save button and the Split view toggle switch
    will be visible on the top, beside the load button.

3.  You can load a new image any time. Doing so would remove the current image.

4.  At the bottom you can choose an action to perform on the image from the dropdown and
    press the Execute button. The actions that you can perform on the current image might change
    depending on the type of image.
    (For example. You cannot get Green Component from the red component of an image)

5.  Everytime an action to image is performed and the current image is updated, the histogram
    is also updated to the histogram of the current image.

6.  Some actions like compress, level Adjust, etc. require additional parameters from the user. A
    popup box will be displayed to get those user parameters. If the user passes invalid
    parameters the program will prompt the user to enter them again.

7.  The application allows Split View Preview to be toggled ON and OFF. When split view is turned
    ON, only few actions are available in the dropbox. Turning ON the split view makes a slider
    visible below the image. This controls the split percentage. The user can slide it to see the
    effect of the action on the image in realtime.
    ACTIONS PERFORMED ON THE IMAGE WHILE SPLIT VIEW IS ON ARE ONLY TEMPORARY!

8.  The save button allows the image to be saved on the disk as a ppm, png or jpg image.
    Any other format is not supported.
    If the user tries to exit the application before saving the current image, a warning prompt is
    shown by the application asking for Exit confirmation.
